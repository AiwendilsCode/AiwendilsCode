- 🚀 **Fast learner** – I quickly grasp new concepts and technologies, whether it’s a new programming language or a cutting-edge tool.
- 🔍 **Curiosity** – I’m constantly exploring new ideas and experimenting with emerging technologies.
- 🌐 **Adaptability** – I thrive in dynamic, changing environments, seamlessly shifting between hardware and software tasks.

## 🏗️ Previous Projects
- 🗣️ [**Arduino Speech Recognition:**](https://github.com/AiwendilsCode/Arduino-speech-commands-recognition) I Developed and trained a neural network for recognizing voice commands from scratch and implemented it on an Arduino Nano. The implementation required optimization tweaks due to the Arduino’s low performance. I used a custom algorithm for training the neural network but also utilized PyTorch to validate my approach.

- 🔢 [**MNIST Number Recognition:**](https://github.com/AiwendilsCode/Neural_network_from_scratch_c_sharp) This project was my first attempt to create a functional neural network from scratch. It provided valuable insights into the workings of neural networks and deep learning principles.

- ⚙️ [**Simplification Algorithms:**](https://github.com/AiwendilsCode/Simplification.NET) I Created a C# API for the Rust implementation of RDP (Ramer-Douglas-Peucker) and Visvalingam-Whyatt algorithms, which are used for line simplification in computer graphics and cartography.

- 🛠️ **Other Smaller Projects:**
  - Created a [**command-line tool for extracting repository states**](https://github.com/AiwendilsCode/GitExporter) after commits into separate folders.
  - Developed a [**PowerShell tool to add paths to the PATH environment variable**](https://github.com/AiwendilsCode/EnvironmentPathAdd), addressing the Windows GUI limit on the number of paths.

## 🔨 Currently Working On
- 🏠 **Homie back-end developer:** Back-end developer for a startup aiming to help young adults to find accommodation.
  
- 🚀 **Als Rocketry club:** Member of a student organization focused on building rockets for competition. My task is to create a battery management system for the rocket's circuitry.
  
- 🔒 **Personal & Work Projects:** In addition to my public projects, I'm working on private personal projects and job-related development, applying my skills to various real-world tasks.

## 💼 Professional Experience
- 👨‍💻 **Backend C# Developer:**
    Worked as a C# backend developer in a company with over 100 employees, focusing on building and selling water heating systems. My responsibilities included developing GUI applications for controlling these systems and connecting the database to the website’s backend, ensuring optimal performance when handling requests.
  
- 📦 **Smart Device for Receiving Courier Packages:**
    Contracted to create a smart device similar to a DHL box for personal use at home. Utilized the ESP32 microcontroller, allowing interaction with the device via a web interface. Device management was possible over the internet, enhancing convenience and accessibility.
